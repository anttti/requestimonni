requestimonni
=============

Simple PHP script to capture request headers, parameters and body.

Just place requestimonni.php to a server, create a monni.log, make sure PHP can write to monni.log and start calling requestimonni. All requests are written to monni.log.

To view the log, call requestimonni.php?log.
To clear the log, call requestimonni.php?clearlog.

You can change the action triggers and the log file name (and location) by editing the first few lines in requestimonni.php.

KTHXBYE
